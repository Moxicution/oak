package debugstream

// DebugStream is not intend for use in productionized apps.
// In general debugstream should be used to provide quick tools
// that can operate on a text stream such as standard Out.
// In some ways this is a stripped down event engine and perhaps should not exist.
//
// Note that all commands are currently treated as lowercase because paranoia.
